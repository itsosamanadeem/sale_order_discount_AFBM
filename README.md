# Odoo Sale Order Discount Module

## Overview
This module enhances discount management in Odoo by providing a wizard-based discount selection system and implementing constraints on discount values based on product pricing rules. It ensures accurate and controlled discounting across all Odoo editions (Community, Enterprise, and Odoo.sh).

## Key Features

### ðŸ›’ Wizard-Based Discount Management
âœ… **Button in Sale Order Line Tree View:** Opens a wizard for discount management.  
âœ… **Create, Edit, or Select Discounts:** Manage discounts directly within the wizard.  
âœ… **New Discount Management Menu:** Allows users to modify and manage discounts separately.  

### ðŸ’° Discount Constraints & Pricelist Integration
âœ… **Automatically applies default discounts** based on the product's pricelist.  
âœ… **Ensures discounts remain within predefined limits** to prevent unauthorized discounting.  
âœ… **Implements real-time validation** using `onchange` methods.  
âœ… **Enforces strict constraints at the database level** for accurate discounting.  

### âš¡ POS-Specific Automation (New Feature)
âœ… **Automatic Sale Order Creation for POS:** If `type_id` is of **POS type**, the system will:  
   - **Automatically create a Sale Order** upon saving.  
   - **Validate and confirm the delivery order** instantly.
